# Module_9_surfsup_challenge

## Project Overview

In order to review weather patterns in Hawaii as we are planning to open a surf and ice cream shop, this project is designed to examine the weather data of both June and December in the local area. By looking at the dataframes of these two months distilled from our datasets. We should be able to assess if our ice cream/surf shop would have an ideal weather condition to operate in.

## Results

The following table summarizes the local climate in June.

June Temperature Dataframe

The following table summarizes the local climate in December.

December Temperature Dataframe

    Average temperature of June and December is about 75 and 71 degrees respectively, showing a moderate temperature and very little temp fluctuation between the two months.

    The maximum temperatures of 85 (June) and 83 (December) are also very similar.

    The minimum temperature of 56 (December) and 64 (June) has the greatest difference in the comparison, this reflects a much lower temperature in December that may not be conducive to ice cream or surfing. 

## Summary

According to our research, the overall weather patterns in December and June are very similar. In our comparison of the two, December has a wider range of temperatures with its high being close to June's but its low well below it.

Meaningful queries that we could also include: Precipation comparison between June and December to determine which month has more rainfall.
